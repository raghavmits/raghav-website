We explored the idea to enhance adhesion between the hydrophobic, inert surfaces of nonporous
substrates and the deposited electrically conducting inks via an intermediate adhesive layer.
The substrates considered included both glass and flexible counterparts like Polyethylene
Terephthalate(PET) and Polyimide(PI). To pack more transistors and circuit elements within a given
area requires a reduction in the line width of the interconnects. Our motivation was to
optimize between high adhesion and low wettability such that the line width of the interconnects
can be further reduced.
