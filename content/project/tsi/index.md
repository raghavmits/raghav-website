A dynamic model has been developed for online assessment of the thermal state of a Blast Furnace. Advanced statistical techniques such as Canonical Correlation, Principal Component Analysis, and Bootstrapping were used for analyzing a dataset from an Integrated Steel Plant. The idea was to come up with a tool to assist operators in ensuring better thermal stability of a Blast Furnace. This model has the potential to be scaled up to hourly frequencies and aid operators in better operational control - adjustments in fuel rate, fine-tuning of blast humidification, oxygen enrichment, etc. Such well-guided decision-making, i.e., backed by knowledge of trends of the thermal state, has tremendous potential to help operators anticipate the occurrence of a hot (economically less viable) or cold (severely affecting productivity) spell in a blast furnace.
