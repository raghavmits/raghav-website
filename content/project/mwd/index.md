This project aims to identify severely damaged buildings in the civil war affected region
of Aleppo, Syria by the application of machine learning. War-related building destruction
is a specific form violence, and in its most extreme form called “urbicide”, where it is
strategically used to displace populations from a settlement area. Monitoring an active
war zone is difficult: as there is a high chance of an information gap due to data being
often incomplete. This is due to several factors. First, it is very difficult to go on the
ground and collect real-time information about security concerns. Second, even in
situations where information does exist, it is often incomplete and highly contested.
Organizations that do report damage often cannot cover the full extent of the region.
Additionally, there is no guarantee that reposting done by local or state owned media is
not prone to bias and misinformation. This lack of information has consequences. It
reduces the scope of humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts, increases the
likelihood of bias in media reporting, and limits potential academic advances in conflict
studies.
