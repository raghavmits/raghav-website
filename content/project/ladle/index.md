A dynamic predictive model has been developed for online monitoring of the desulphurization process in a ladle. Machine
learning techniques, Ridge Regression and Neural Networks, were used for analyzing a dataset from ArcelorMittal,
Dofasco. Upon integration with real-time operations, the suggested model holds tremendous potential to optimize ladle
heats by reducing the processing time, product off-grades and consumption of flux, argon and electricity. Economic
assessment showed that cumulatively these factors can contribute to significant savings on the production front.
