Developed a process simulation based framework taking into consideration the complexities and stochasticity of plant operations. Making use of a strong operational database, plant specific configurations and operations can be simulated to predict the impact of one or multiple events on ladle turnaround time, productivity, energy and consumable consumption. Bottlenecks can be identified and various what-if scenarios can be tested to determine the most efficient debottlenecking measure for a specific problem.
