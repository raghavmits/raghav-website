The tundish open eye is a complex phenomenon whose effect on steel has not been fully understood yet and is an ongoing
endeavor. Equally complex is the process in which it forms because of its inherent multi-phase and multi-physics nature.
The modelling method shown in this work, while relatively simple to implement, has profound predictive
capabilities. The base data was gathered and clustered to identify the process variables having high correlation. From here a model was built and augmented through boot strap aggregation. With enough data, some basic feature engineering, and a widely available machine learning framework, a complex phenomenon such as the tundish open eye can be better anticipated.
