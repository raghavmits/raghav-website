I am a data scientist with over four years of experience driving operational improvements, energy optimization, and geospatial projects. I specialize in inferential thinking techniques—such as hypothesis testing and causal inference—as well as predictive modeling and data mining to create, test, and deploy adaptive solutions that translate business requirements into impactful outcomes.

I thrive on collaborating with clients and stakeholders, deeply understanding their needs, and iterating to deliver tailored, high-quality solutions. I enjoy working in fast-paced, dynamic environments and am a passionate engineer, constantly learning and building innovative solutions that positively impact society.

Feel free to reach out for any exciting opportunities!
