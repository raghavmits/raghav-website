I am an Associate Consultant with {{< staticref "http://www.dastur.com/" "newtab" >}}M.N. Dastur & Co.{{< /staticref >}} in the {{< staticref "http://www.dasturenergy.com/" "newtab" >}}Energy{{< /staticref >}} and Process Metallurgy division since 2018. I have worked on projects in Sustainability and Operations Improvement for some of the leading players in the Iron & Steel and Oil & Gas industries. Parallelly, I have been developing predictive models aimed at enhancing process control by leveraging machine learning techniques.

Over the last two years, Dastur Energy has prioritized sustainability as the bedrock of new initiatives. Given the magnitude and the increasing rate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, we have been working on decarbonizing major emitters in the heavy industry – oil refineries and integrated steel plants (ISPs). My role in these ventures has centered around the selection and simulation of appropriate carbon capture technologies. We modeled PFDs for Rectisol and Selexol based pre-combustion CO2 capture units coupled with gas conditioning units using {{< staticref "https://www.aspentech.com/en/products/engineering/aspen-hysys" "newtab" >}}Aspen Hysys{{< /staticref >}}. These PFDs were the basis for conceptualization of the world's first Hyper-Scale CO2-EOR enabling Petrochemicals Complex for a UAE based Oil & Gas Company. At present, we are designing an industrial-scale solution for capturing 50-70% of CO2 emissions from Blast Furnace gas at a 5 MTPA ISP facility in Illinois (US DoE funded). These projects' experiences and a strong drive to engage more rigorously with Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies have galvanized me to apply for graduate studies.
