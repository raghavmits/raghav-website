Raghav has extensive experience as a data scientist with a technology consulting firm, {{< staticref "http://www.dasturenergy.com/" "newtab" >}}Dastur Energy{{< /staticref >}}, advising steel companies on energy optimization, operations improvement and decarbonization strategies. Learning independently about advances in machine learning and its applications in manufacturing, he played a leading role in the organization, steering several initiatives in digital transformation. He has collaborated with subject matter experts, experienced plant engineers, and simulations specialists to design predictive models for enhanced control over manufacturing processes.

While at Dastur Energy, his team prioritized sustainability as the bedrock of new initiatives. Given the magnitude and the increasing rate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the team worked on decarbonizing major emitters in the heavy industry – oil refineries and integrated steel plants (ISPs). Raghav's role in these ventures has centered around the selection and simulation of appropriate carbon capture technologies.

Through the projects undertaken, he has demonstrated mental agility while navigating uncertainty and ambiguity across the design, development, and deployment stages. He can work well in a team on account of his pleasing personality, which endears him to one and all. He is amiable and trustworthy. With his motivation, sincerity, and perseverance, Raghav can most satisfactorily and logically accomplish the task assigned to him.
